# Anomaly Detection Project

### TU Delft | CSE2525: Data Mining



## Overview

This repository contains a data mining project developed for the course **CSE2525: Data Mining** at **TU Delft**. The project's primary goal was to perform anomaly detection on a given dataset using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).



## Project Description

The notebook provided (`anomaly-detection.ipynb`) demonstrates our approach to anomaly detection, which includes:

- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and selection
- Application of anomaly detection using DTW and PCA
- Evaluation of model performance
- Visualization of results

The notebook clearly presents the step-by-step analysis, algorithm implementation, and insights derived from the data.


## Data Privacy

Due to the dataset's size and possible privacy concerns, the original dataset used in this project has not been included in the repository. The notebook shared in this repository includes pre-computed results, outputs, and visualizations, ensuring the project's reproducibility and transparency.
